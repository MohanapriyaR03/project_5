This article talks about the history of the LBSNAA and <br>also a few interesting facts about it.</p>
    <p>It all started on 15th April 1958 when the then Home Minister, Govind Ballabh Pant<br> announced in the Lok Sabha that a National Academy of Administration would be set up to give<br> training to all civil services recruits. Then under the behest of the Ministry of<br> Home Affairs, the IAS Training School, Delhi and the IAS Staff College, Shimla was<br> amalgamated to form the National Academy of Administration at Mussoorie in 1959. The Academy underwent two<br> name changes. In October 1972, it was renamed as the Lal Bahadur Shastri Academy<br> of Administration. And, in July 1973, the institution acquired its present name of the Lal Bahadur<br> Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA).</p>
    <p>Initially, the training of the first batch of officers had started in Metcalfe<br> House in April 1959. Then in September of that year, the Academy shifted to Charleville Hotel,<br> Mussoorie. Many buildings have been added over the years since then</p>
